      <h2>Tutorial 1: DICOM on Rails!</h2>
      <h3>Populating a Ruby on Rails database with data from your DICOM directory</h3>
      <p>Although my primary idea when starting the Ruby DICOM project was really not about making a Rails application,
      the interest I've seen initially has in large part has been related to Rails, so I thought I'd go ahead and make that the
      subject of my first tutorial.</p>

      <p>Let us start with a list of what you'll need for this tutorial:</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></p>
      <p><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/dicom">ruby-dicom</a></p>
      <p><a href="http://pullmonkey.com/2008/7/23/open-flash-chart-ii-plugin-for-ruby-on-rails-ofc2">Open Flash Chart 2 plugin for Rails</a> (Optional: This is used to make some nice-looking graphs in our web interface)</p>

      <p>The goal in this tutorial: To transfer all relevant content from our local DICOM storage directory to
      a database which will be accessible through a web front end to facilitate easy oversight of our data.
      This will be done in two steps: (1) Creating the database/web front end using Rails and (2) populating
      the database with our DICOM data using a Ruby script.</p>

      <p><h3>Part 1: Setting up the Rails environment</h3></p>
      <p>Our DICOM directory contains files from patients that have received diagnostic X-ray CT examinations.
      We will make a simple database that contains 5 entries: patient name, examination study, X-ray voltage, current and exposure.
      In addition to the normal Rails setup, we want to add the possibility of clicking on an examination study and filter the database based on the selected study.
      OK, assuming you have installed the necessary components, let's go ahead and create our database:</p>

      <pre class="src">$ rails new dicom<br/>$ cd dicom<br/>$ rake db:create:all<br/>$ rails generate scaffold Examination study:string name:string voltage:string current:string exposure:string<br/>$ rake db:migrate</pre>

      <p>Now we have the basic Rails environment set up. It will give you the option of viewing all database entries
      in a long list, as well as selecting a single entry and view its details. You may even edit or delete entries, although that is not of interest to us in this situation.
      What we want to do is making the examination study a hyperlink, which when clicked makes Rails display only the patients that have had this particular study.
      In addition, we will add a line at the bottom of our list which gives us the average exposure in the list displayed at the screen.
      In order to do this, two files have to be modified. First we will modify the controller: /app/controllers/examinations_controller.rb</p>

      <p>In the method index, we will add a variable @study used for the filtering as well as a variable
      used for calculating mean exposure values. The @mean_exposure variable sits inside an if statement.
      When finished, the index method looks like this:</p>

<pre class="src">
def index
  @examinations = Examination.find(:all)
  @study = params[:study]
  @mean_exposure = Examination.average(:exposure, :conditions => ['study == ?', @study]) if @study<br/>
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # index.html.erb
    format.xml  { render :xml => @examinations }
  end
end
</pre>

      <p>Next, we need to modify the Ruby-embedded HTML file that displays the list of entries: /app/views/examinations/index.html.erb</p>

      <p>What happens in this file is that a table is generated, where the content (database records) is inserted with an iterator.
      In this iterator we need to insert an if statement, so that a database record will not be displayed if the @study keyword is set
      and the database record's study differs from the chosen one. In addition, the study field must be made into a hyperlink
      with an action that calls the index method in the controller. Furthermore, at the bottom of the displayed page we want the average
      exposure value to be displayed, but only if a certain study has been selected. When finished, the file should look something like this:</p>

<pre class="src">
&lt;h1&gt;Listing examinations&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Study&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Voltage&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Current&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Exposure&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;<br/>
&lt;% @examinations.each do |examination| %&gt;
  &lt;% unless @study and @study != examination.study %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to examination.study, :action =&gt; 'index', :study =&gt; examination.study %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= examination.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= examination.voltage %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= examination.current %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= examination.exposure %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Show', examination %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_examination_path(examination) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to 'Destroy', examination, :confirm =&gt; 'Are you sure?', :method =&gt; :delete %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;<br/>
&lt;% if @mean_exposure %&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;%= "Mean exposure: #{@mean_exposure}" %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;%= link_to 'Show all', examinations_path %&gt;
</pre>

      <p>That's it for the database/web front end. You can check it out to make sure everything is ok by running the following command:</p>

      <pre class="src">$ rails server</pre>

      <p>That starts the web server, and you access it by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:3000/examinations">localhost</a>.</p>

      <p><h3>Part 2: Setting up a script to read the DICOM directory and store tag data in our Rails database</h3></p>
      <p>We now need to make a script that gives us access to the Rails database, discovers all the files contained in the
      chosen directory, including all its subdirectories, and finally reads the DICOM data and puts it in the database.</p>

      <p><em>Task 1: Access to the Rails database</em></p>
      <p>First of all, to be able to access the Rails database, the script must be executed from within the folder
      of the Rails project. Furthermore, our script needs to require some modules and load the database.
      As such, the start of our script file will look like this:</p>

<pre class="src">
# Libraries required:
require 'find'
require 'active_record'
require 'dicom'<br/>
# Load your yml config from rails:
db_config = YAML::load(File.open("./config/database.yml"))
# Connect to the proper database:
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(db_config['development'])
# Load the custom model we created earlier:
require './app/models/examination'
</pre>

      <p><em>Task 2: Get a list of all the files contained within the folder</em></p>
      <p>For this task we will use a neat little script that fits the job quite well.
      It allows you to specify an array of folders to be searched (a search which includes any sub-folders).</p>

<pre class="src">
# Discover all the files contained in the specified directory and all its sub-directories:
dirs = ["/home/dicomdir"]
files = Array.new
for dir in dirs
  Find.find(dir) do |path|
    if FileTest.directory?(path)
      next
    else
      files &lt;&lt; path  # Store the file in our array
    end
  end
end
</pre>

      <p><em>Tasks 3 and 4: Extract DICOM data from each file and store it in the database</em></p>
      <p>The last two tasks we'll do inside an iterator which traverses our file string array and
      reads the files using the ruby-dicom library. If a particular file is successfully parsed as a DICOM object,
      it extracts the tags that we are interested in, creates a new database record and writes our tags to it.
      Note that in this example the directory contains only one DICOM file per patient. If your real directory
      contains several files per patient, which is not at all unreasonable, you will have to insert some logic
      to deal with that.</p>

<pre class="src">
# Use a loop to run through all the files, reading its data and transferring it to the database.
files.each do |file|
  # Read the file:
  dcm = DICOM::DObject.read(file)
  # If the file was read successfully as a DICOM file, go ahead and extract content:
  if dcm.read?
    study = dcm.value("0008,1030")
    name = dcm.value("0010,0010")
    voltage = dcm.value("0018,0060")
    current = dcm.value("0018,1151")
    exposure = dcm.value("0018,1152")
    # Store the data in the database:
    e = Examination.new
    e.study = study
    e.name = name
    e.voltage = voltage
    e.current = current
    e.exposure = exposure
    e.save
  end
end
</pre>

      <p>Let us name the script <i>populate_dicom.rb</i>. Execute it (<i>ruby populate_dicom.rb</i>), then sit back and
      relax while it does all the work and populates your Rails database!</p>

      <p>That's it! We now have a working Rails database with our DICOM directory data loaded into it.
      Launch the webserver and point your browser to localhost to see how it looks!</p>

      <p><img src="./content/tutorial1-1.png" width="510" height="577" alt="Webserver screenshot"></p>

      <p>Clicking on a link of one of the examination types gives you an overview of patients
      who have received that particular examination:</p>

      <p><img src="./content/tutorial1-2.png" width="472" height="202" alt="Webserver screenshot, category"></p>

      <p>Note that the actual values in this particular database are mostly made up, so don't
      pay too much attention to them. When importing strings into the database, you may
      discover that some of them could do with some formatting to make it a bit nicer.
      Luckily, Ruby has a lot of nice methods for string processing, like upcase, downcase, joining, splitting
      and capitalizing, so that should be fairly straight forward.</p>

      <p><p><h3>Bonus Part: Inserting a flash chart to get a nice, graphical of the distribution of studies</h3></p></p>
      <p>There are various approaches if you want to include som charts in your Rails application,
      and although I am no fan of Flash in general, I have to say <a href="http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/">Open Flash Chart</a> is a pretty nice tool for the job.
      To install this I believe you need to have Git installed. Follow <a href="http://git.or.cz/">this link for the Unix version</a>,
      or <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">go here for the Git Windows version</a>.
      For installing the Rails plugin for Open Flash Charts, follow the link at the top of this page.
      In short, run the following command in your rails project folder, then copy two files to their destination
      as explained in the link.</p>

      <pre class="src">$ rails plugin install git://github.com/pullmonkey/open_flash_chart.git</pre>

      <p>What we are going to do is make a pie chart which shows us the distribution of the
      examination studies that exist in the DICOM Rails database. To accomplish this, we will make a new
      controller that handles the pie chart and edit this to construct our data of interest. Furthermore we will make
      a corresponding index.html.erb file which will display the chart, and lastly, insert a link in our examination view
      which points to this chart. Start by creating the new controller:</p>

      <pre class="src">$ rails generate controller Pie</pre>

      <p>We also need to make a minor addition to our routes. Open RAILS_ROOT/config/routes.rb and add these two lines:</p>

<pre class="src">
match "pie" => "pie#index"
match "pie/graph_code" => "pie#graph_code"
</pre>

      <p>Next, we need to create a index.html.erb file for this controller, in the folder RAILS_ROOT/app/views/pie/
      and insert the following code to that file:</p>

<pre class="src">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/javascripts/swfobject.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;%=raw @graph %&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Now we need to modify the controller to create the chart and use the data that is of interest to us.
      Edit the file pie_controller.rb, which you will find in the RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/ folder, with the following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
class PieController &lt; ApplicationController<br/>
  def index
    @graph = open_flash_chart_object(800,600,"/pie/graph_code")
  end<br/>
  def graph_code
    # Determine the distribution of examination studies in the database:
    examinations = Examination.all
    studies = Array.new
    examinations.each do |e|
      studies &lt;&lt; e.study
    end
    unique = studies.uniq
    results = Hash.new
    unique.each do |u|
      results[u] = studies.select{|s| s == u}.length
    end
    # Create the pie chart and insert the determined data:
    title = Title.new("Distribution of Studies")
    pie = Pie.new
    pie.start_angle = 35
    pie.animate = true
    pie.tooltip = '#val# of #total#&lt;br&gt;#percent#'
    pie.colours = ["#0000ff", "#ff0000", "#00ff00"]
    values = Array.new
    results.each do |k, v|
      values &lt;&lt; PieValue.new(v, k)
    end
    pie.values = values
    chart = OpenFlashChart.new
    chart.title = title
    chart.add_element(pie)
    chart.x_axis = nil
    render :text => chart.to_s
  end<br/>
end
</pre>

      <p>Note that I have specified 3 colours here, as I know I have 3 elements in my chart.
      If you don't know how many elements that will make up your chart, you can either avoid specifying
      the colours altogether, or you need to use some logic to set up the correct number of colors that is needed for your chart.</p>

      <p>Our chart is ready: all that remains is to edit the index.html.erb file of the examinations controller, so that it will
      display a link at the top of the page, pointing to the chart we just made.
      Add the following lines at the top of the file:</p>

<pre class="src">
&lt;% unless @study %&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to 'Pie Chart of the study distribution', 'pie' %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The link will be displayed at the top of the page when you are at the "main" page (when displaying selected
      studies or single database entries it will be hidden). Clicking on the link will reveal the nice-looking flash pie chart,
      where a small information box will appear as your mouse hovers above a slice:</p>

      <p><img src="./content/tutorial1-3b.png" width="603" height="597" alt="Flash Pie Chart"></p>

      <p>That's it! You now have a working Rails database containing a snapshot of the content of your DICOM directory.
      It may not be that pretty (admittedly I am no expert in neither Rails nor HTML), but with the basic functionality illustrated it should
      be a good starting point for you to make something useful from. Now go on an impress your boss with a snazzy DICOM on Rails web application!</p>

      <p>I hope you have found this tutorial helpful, and as always: All feedback is appreciated!</p>
